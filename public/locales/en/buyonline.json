  "buyonline-text1": "<p>Would you like to buy an item from a private seller or company but, for any reason, you donâ€™t feel guaranteed enough? Try sicuro.com! After you have started a transaction and with just a few clicks, we will ask you to make your payment on our deposits account instead of paying the seller directly. We will then notify the seller when we receive your payment so he will be asked to send you the goods or service you required, that you can inspect within the time limits which you agreed. Only when you confirm that everything is all right or if we do not receive any feedback within the time limits you have agreed upon, we will send the payment to the seller. If there is something wrong, you can come to an agreement with our partner with one of the following solutions:<1><2>- return the merchandise and get the money back</2><2>- possible discount in the accorded price</2></1></p>",
  "buyonline-text2": "<1>No operation will be performed unless we have your explicit consent!</1><p>But remember that if you fail to respond within the given time limits, we will understand it as a tacit consent. Also note that, if the operation will be canceled for a missing delivery of goods, we will ask you to pay our fees in full, even if you have previously agreed otherwise. Please consider that, if the operation was not successful, our security service still saved your money and you can get your payment back.</p>"
